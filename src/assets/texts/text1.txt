Subvocalization, or si(i)lent speech,||| is the internal speech typically made when reading;||| it provi(i)des the sound of the word as it is read.||| This is a natural process when reading,||| and it helps the mi(i)nd to access meanings to comprehend and remember what is read,||| potentially reducing cognitive load.||| This||| inner||| speech||| is characteri(i)zed by(y) minuscule movements in the larynx and other muscles||| involved in the articu(u)la(a)tion of speech.||| Most of these movements are undetectable (without the aid of machines) by(y) the person who is reading.||| The explora(a)tion into the evolutionary background of subvocalization is currently very limited.||| The little known is predominantly about language acquisition and memory.||| Evolutionary psy(y)chologists||| suggest||| that the development of subvocalization is rela(a)ted to |||modular||| aspects of the brain.||| There has been a great amount of explora(a)tion on the evolutionary ba(a)sis of universal grammar.||| <br>
