Subvocalization, or silent speech,||| 
is the internal speech typically made when reading;||| 
it provides the sound of the word as it is read.||| 
This is a natural process when reading,||| 
and it helps the mind to access meanings to comprehend and remember what is read,||| 
potentially reducing cognitive load.||| 
This||| 
inner||| 
speech||| 
is characterized by minuscule movements in the larynx and other muscles||| 
involved in the articulation of speech.||| 
Most of these movements are undetectable (without the aid of machines) by the person who is reading.||| 
The exploration into the evolutionary background of subvocalization is currently very limited.||| 
The little known is predominantly about language acquisition and memory.||| 
Evolutionary psychologists||| 
suggest||| 
that the development of subvocalization is related to |||
modular||| 
aspects of the brain.||| 
There has been a great amount of exploration on the evolutionary basis of universal grammar.|||
